Sentiment Analysis on News Articles

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on news articles sourced from various RSS feeds. 
Leveraging AWS Comprehend, a natural language processing service, the project extracts news data, analyzes sentiment, 
and stores the results in a MySQL database. 
The project is implemented as an AWS Lambda function, enabling serverless execution and scalability.
